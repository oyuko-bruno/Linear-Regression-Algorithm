# Linear-Regression-Algorithm
In this project, I implemented a linear regression machine learning  model to analyze salary dataset. Leveraging the power  of linear regression, this project aims to check years of experience affecting salary and vs versa.
#Key Features:
Utilized  key libraries  such as NumPy, pandas, or scikit-learn.
Preprocessed the data by  data cleaning, handling missing values, or feature scaling.
#Tech Stack:python,jupyter
#Future Scope:
Plan to implement more advanced machine learning techniques like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to enhance the predictive power.
Intend to explore feature engineering to improve model performance and incorporate more data sources for comprehensive analysis.
