# Linear-Regression-Algorithm
In this project, I implemented a linear regression machine learning  model to analyze salary dataset. Leveraging the power  of linear regression, this project aims to check years of eperience affecting salary and vs versa.
Key Features:
Utilized  key libraries  such as NumPy, pandas, or scikit-learn.
Preprocessed the data by  data cleaning, handling missing values, or feature scaling.
